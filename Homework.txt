How similar was your plan to the final program? Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?

We planned the classes variables an methods ahead  we could do the extensions. Everything went to plan.
The plan consisted in 4 boxes representing 4 diferent classes, named Pub, Food, Customer and drink.

Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle? Or are any of your classes doing too much?

The way we designed our classes did put most of the methods in 2 of them "Pub and Customer", the other 2 were not as populated.
Pub and customer were well balanced.

Did you practice TDD?

Yes, all the methods were written on TDD fashion. 4 TDD files were created to test the respective classes.

Are each of your methods tested? Did you find anything difficult to test?

Yes all methods were tested, we planned the methods before implementing so we didn't have to deal with many failures.
