How similar was your plan to the final program? Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?

We planned the classes variables an methods ahead  we could do the extensions. Everything went to plan


Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle? Or are any of your classes doing too much?

The way we designed our classes did put most of the methods in 2 of them, and other 2 were not as populated.
The 2 classes we have most functions are quite even.


Did you practice TDD?

Yes, all the methods were writen on TDD fashion

Are each of your methods tested? Did you find anything difficult to test?

Yes all methods were tested, some did require some thinking before we writen them therefore not many failures occured.
